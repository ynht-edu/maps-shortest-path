# maps-shortest-path

This is actually my uni coursework assignment. I replicate e-maps shortest or fastest route feature with _priority queue_ optimized Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features:
- Tepresent nodes of a graph with city name (string).
- Evaluate the shortest route to the destinated city based on the distance of the route.
- Random congestion case.
- Evaluate the fastest route to the destinated city based on possible time.
- The possible time is determined by the average speed and congestion case (the length of the congestion and average speed of user while the congestion happens).
